# Announcing Azdora Online

*This is the beginning of a long road, and we’re glad you’re here at the very first steps.*

**Azdora Online** is our take on a high-fantasy MMORPG role-playing server for Hytale, built during Early Access with the clear intention of growing alongside its community.

The world, systems, and lore are still taking shape, practically at the same time as Hytale itself, but this is not a weakness for us, nor for players or modders. It is an opportunity to develop a server with direct feedback from the community that will go through many iterations as we develop custom content for it.

Our design philosophy is close to that intended of the team developing the base game: **we want something created by players for players.** We want you to join us as this becomes something worth playing and remembering.

Our goal is clear but demanding: **to create a living world that rewards curiosity, commitment, and player choice.** We want Azdora to be this amazing land handcrafted to be explored rather than rushed through, and for the player to be not pushed into a single optimal path or a rigid class fantasy, but to interact in open multiple viable playstyles. To make this work, we have set ourselves the following goals, which are, of course, subject to change as we work on developing the server:

### Our first steps: 

* Visit the first zone: **Aurora Valley**. In it, the peaceful village of Valorhaven is set with friendly NPCs, small quests, a tavern, a PvP coliseum, and lots of secrets to discover.
* Choose between **six starter classes**: warrior, rogue, mage, priest, druid and shadow mage, each one with their own abilities.
* Fight **hordes of hostile mobs** and loot their camps.

### Our vision for the future:

* Expand the world of **Azdora**: to build a handcrafted map with different biomes, zones, towns, POIs, dungeons, etc.
* Develop a deep hybrid **skill tree**: learn skills and escale into other classes branches for abilities to accomplish specialized builds.
* Design and model **custom weapons, items, and mobs** to populate the world of Azdora.
* Choose **from different races** with unique cosmetics and passive abilities.
* Loot **epic items** for the player to search with the potential to totally change your gameplay.
* Conquer **massive dungeons** with branching paths and dynamic mechanics, that encourages preparation, certain items and research into lore.
* **Player housing**: take ownership and decorate your own home within the different kingdoms of Azdora.
* Join **guilds** with custom bases, NPCs and participate in global rankings and raids.
* Hop on your **mount**: a system for obtaining creatures to travel quickly along roads.
* **A living world** shaped by dynamic NPCs, shifting factions, open wars, and live events where players participate.
* An original **and in-depth lore** to be unraveled through books, landmarks, conversations, item descriptions and questlines.
* Dynamic **economy**: A P2P and P2S resource and item trading system with a unified currency.
* Forge alliances and rivalries through **social systems**, shared activities, mini-games, and much more!

If that search of the unknown excites you, you’re in the right place. Test the systems, question our design, break things, and help us rebuild them better. If you want to help us with development, you can join our Discord channel. **We are also looking for modelers, programmers, and artists to work with and to bring new ideas.**

*Azdora Online will only become what you dare to shape it into!*

## Our vision

## Lore Tidbit

At the dawn of time, the Multiple Worlds emerged from primordial darkness, shaped by gods that gave purpose through power: Say’Ka, The Sacred Light, Knoloch, The Endless Scroll, and Thraox, the Errand, lord of Chaos.

Azdora, the last world born, was populated by the lesser beings: humans, elves, and dwarves briefly knew harmony before conflict arose; after a harsh war, they banished the demonic hordes into the unknown depths of the earth.

Now, the Age of Ruin has begun. Lingering fragments of magic still stirs within some new heroes, holding the fate of Azdora and the gods themselves.
